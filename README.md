# ParkingSystem

This is an arduino project used for making smarter parking spaces in which ultrasonic sensors sense the presence of a car in each parking slot. If the total capacity of the area is full, a message will flash up saying that the parking space is full so that the administrators can take required actions. This reduces the probability of human error when checking for available parking space and is much faster. Currently, there is only one parking slot but, this project can be extended to multiple parking slots by adding sensors and arduinos.
